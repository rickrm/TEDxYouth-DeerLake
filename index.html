                          The ultimate goal of TEDxYouth@Deerlake 2019, the inaugural TEDx youth event in Burnaby, is to amplify good ideas, present them in a meaningful way, and create new conversations as well as awareness from them. Our diverse selection of young and experienced speakers will share their ideas worth spreading. For those who carry the potential for tremendous impact, TEDxYouth@Deerlake is a platform and a voice. For those who love to organize, actualize, and inspire, TEDxYouth@Deerlake is a chance to exemplify leadership. We want to give students in Burnaby student-made opportunities and to inspire everyone to better their community in their own unique ways.

                                    <p>
                                            Dawn is a Computing Science and Linguistics student at Simon Fraser University (SFU). She is the former President of SFU Women in Computing Science (WiCS). She was the lead organizer of a hackathon for SFU students, as well as Try/CATCH: a conference for high school girls to learn about Computing Science. She founded the WiCS Mentorship Program, and helped start CodeMavens: a weekly technical interview workshop that she still runs today, which has given many women the interview skills needed to obtain technical jobs. Dawn has also been an executive member of the SFU Computing Science Student Society, a speaker at SFU Welcome Day, and a volunteer for many women in tech initiatives.

                                            In her software engineering career, Dawn has completed 4 internships: Environment Canada in Vancouver, Thomson Reuters and IBM in Toronto, and Collective Health in San Francisco. The internships, conferences, and hackathons that Dawn has done have taken her all over North America, and even to China, as a Huawei Seeds for the Future scholar. Despite her success in Computing Science, when Dawn graduated from high school, she was an aspiring writer who never wanted to do math again and had no clue how to code!

                                                <br>
                                                “To me, breaking barriers is less of going against society instead more of having
                                                the courage to become someone you strive to be no matter what others think. Barriers are
                                                created by your own mind only, in the end, if you are able to push away what others think
                                                and gather up enough willpower to achieve what you desire then barriers wouldn’t exist
                                                in the first place. Barriers are just excuses for people that are unable to stand up for
                                                themselves or are unable to become what they want. Breaking barriers is becoming more
                                                than what others think and having the power to defeat your own mind from stopping you.”

After completing his Bachelor of Music in Manitoba, He came to Vancouver to complete the teacher training program at UBC where he is currently working on his master's in education. 
                                                From the time Ryan was a high school student, to his experience as a musician and music educator, to his time now as a high school principal, our sense of belonging has always been a topic of interest to him. As Ryan work towards completing his Master of Arts in Education in the Department of Curriculum and Pedagogy,  he looks at how music is able to bring people together and how we might apply those same principles to improve our communities and relationships with others.

It is difficult to see and acknowledge the many social, financial, physical, and institutional barriers faced by ourselves and by others, but by endeavouring to understand and recognize these barriers we can begin to break them down together and, in that process, foster the connections we seek.”

He has taught himself to create complex robots & devices, and has mastered programming languages to program websites, web servers, and even just computer chips, on his own! Although software and hardware may not be designed to integrate, he still enjoys forcing them to. He first began building circuits when he was 7, which led him to areas like robotics, mechanics, computer science, web development, and everything in between. In the small portion of his life outside of electronics, he is a competitive trampolinist and enjoys doing all sorts of flips, as well as loving the outdoors.

It's usually seen as an almost impossible thing to    do, but sometimes it just takes some focus,         stubbornness and determination.”
